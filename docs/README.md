# Critical-Care Land outline: 
The following is the outline for this project. The project concludes critical-care/emergency case reports based on the _CARE Guidelines_, _Scientific Models_ that illustrate the scientific bases and theory behind 
these phenomena in a miniaturized form of the actualization, and finally some guidelines summaries, typically from NICE, AHA, ATS, ESC, and SCCM.

## Case Reports: 
> [!NOTE]
> All patient information are protected! These reports didn't require an informed consent at the moment of writing;
> as patient demographic data are completely wiped out, these are anonymous docs.
>
> All these reports are Open Access and based on the CARE guidelines.
